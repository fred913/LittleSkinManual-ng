# Email Ticket

If you wish to receive technical support but do not want to join our official user discussion group, or if you have discovered something unspeakable and serious (such as severe bugs or vulnerabilities) that you want to inform the operations team about, or if you simply wish to get in touch with the operations team, you can send an email ticket.

## Support Email

Email address: [support@littlesk.in](mailto:support@littlesk.in)

We recommend that you send emails from the email address bound to your LittleSkin account, as this helps us verify your identity to improve efficiency.

Emails sent to this address will be seen by the operations team and the community support team only. We will reply to emails we deem necessary as soon as possible.

All replies will be sent from the following email addresses:

| From                   | Email Domain           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Operations Team        | `@littlesk.in`         |
| Community Support Team | `@commspt.littlesk.in` |

::: tip Tip
For general technical support emails, we might delegate them to the community support team. The community support team is not provided by the operations team, but the personnel are appointed by the operations team.
:::

::: warning Caution
When receiving emails from members of the LittleSkin operations team or the community support team, please carefully check the domain name of the sender's email (the part after `@` in the email address).

If the email domain is not `littlesk.in` or `commspt.littlesk.in`, it means that the email was not sent by a member of the LittleSkin operations team or the community support team, and its contents may not be reliable. Please be cautious.
:::

::: danger Remember
Please note that, under no circumstances will members of the operations team or the community support team ask you for your password or other login credentials for any website.

If someone asks you for your password, verification code, or other information, please stop communicating immediately and report to us via our external support email.

## Rules

Email is much more formal than instant messaging. To improve efficiency and ensure a calm and respectful communication, please adhere to the following rules when sending emails:

- Before asking, please read and fully understand [What to do if you encounter a problem](/problems.md);
- Use clear and concise language in the email subject to summarize your issue or request;
- Describe your problem or request in detail in the email body, and attach corresponding logs or other materials;
- Maintain good manners and respect;
- Minimize unnecessary emails;
- Be patient and wait for a reply, do not frequently urge for a response.

When replying to our emails, please CC (carbon copy) our external support email to help us keep track of the conversation.

## Response Time

Email is not instant messaging. Although email may be more efficient than instant messaging, it also involves more work and slower processing speeds. All emails will generally be replied to within three days to a week, but emails we deem unnecessary to reply to will not receive a response.

After sending an email, please wait patiently for a reply. If you do not receive a reply after a long time, you may send another email to inquire. However, please do not send emails frequently over a short period, as your email address may be blacklisted.
