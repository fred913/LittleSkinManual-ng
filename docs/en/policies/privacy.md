# Privacy Statement

During the use of LittleSkin, LittleSkin (hereinafter referred to as "we") may collect some private information (hereinafter referred to as "information") about the user (hereinafter referred to as "you"). We highly value the security of your information, and this statement will explain why and how we use, store, and protect your information.

Unless otherwise specified, this privacy statement applies to all activities between you and LittleSkin. We may change this statement without notifying you, and the changes will apply to all users.

LittleSkin reserves the right of final interpretation of this statement.

## Information We Collect Actively and the Reasons

We will actively collect the following information:

- **Username, character name, email address, password**: We need this information to identify user identity, which is the basis for providing our services;
- **IP address**: We need to record IP addresses to prevent attacks and abuse, conduct data analysis and investigation, and provide better services;
- **Cookies**: We need Cookies to identify user identity and determine session status, and to provide better services;
- **Partial information from third parties**: We need this information to identify user identity, conduct data analysis and investigation, and provide better services;
- **Other necessary information**: To provide services, we must collect this information.

In fact, you are not required to provide this information, but in most cases, if you do not provide this information, we will not be able to provide services to you.

## How We Collect Your Information

We will follow the principle of minimization to collect information, that is, only collect necessary information.

In most cases, most of the information will be provided by you. Information such as IP addresses and Cookies that are automatically transmitted in Internet communications will be directly obtained from the corresponding network requests.

Some information may be provided by third parties with or without your consent (e.g., user information obtained through third-party OAuth login). We will only request the information we need from third parties, but what information they ultimately provide to us will be decided by the corresponding entity.

## How We Use, Store, and Protect Your Information

In most cases, we will only use your information to provide as good a service as possible and continuously improve the services we offer. We will also use your information for data analysis and investigation.

To provide services, we may use your information to generate more information. Although it may be possible to identify users to some extent through the information we generate, it does not constitute private information. Due to the special nature of the service, we may disclose this information to the public.

Some information will be stored in plaintext, while some information will be stored after being encoded, encrypted, or hashed; some information will be stored in our database, while some information will be directly stored on your local computer.

To better provide services, we may provide some of your information to third parties without your permission, but we will provide as little information as possible. We will try our best to ensure that third parties process your information according to their privacy policies and relevant laws and regulations, and we will specify in the "Third-Party Services We Use" section of this privacy statement which third-party entities provide which services and their corresponding privacy policies for your review.

Protecting users' information from being illegally obtained is our obligation. Unless with your permission, or LittleSkin merges with other entities, or is affected by force majeure, we will not actively disclose your information to third parties in unnecessary situations, nor will we sell your information to third parties for any purpose.

## Ownership, Retention, and Deletion of User Information

Although we may store your information, you still retain ownership of your information. In most cases, we will only access and store your information when necessary, and will immediately delete information that is not necessary to retain after use.

You can contact us at any time to delete your information, or delete your account through the "Delete Account" function on the personal profile page, thereby deleting your information, but we also have the right to refuse any unreasonable requests to delete information. If we believe that deleting information will prevent us from providing normal services to you and other users, we may also refuse your request to delete information. Although we can delete the information we store, this does not mean we can require third parties to delete the information they store.

Some information may be re-obtained or generated after being deleted.
